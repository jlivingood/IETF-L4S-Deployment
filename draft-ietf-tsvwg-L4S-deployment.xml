		<t>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental RFCs for Low Latency, 
		Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior <xref target="RFC9330"/>

		a new architecture and protocol for deploying low latency networking. 
		But as is normal for many such standards, especially those in 
		experimental status, certain deployment decisions are ultimately left to implementers.</t>
		
		<t>This document explores the potential implications of key deployment decisions and makes 
		recommendations for those decisions that may help drive adoption. In particular, there are best practices based 
        on prior experience 
		as a network operator that should be considered and there are network neutrality types of considerations 
		as well. These technologies are benign on their own, but the way they are operationally implemented can 
		determine whether they are ultimately perceived positively and adopted by the broader Internet ecosystem. 
		That is a key issue for low latency networking, because the more applications developers and edge platforms that adopt 
		new packet marking for low latency traffic, then the greater the value to end users, so ensuring it is received well 
		is key to driving strong initial adoption.</t>
		
		<t>It is worth stating though that these decisions are not embedded in or inherent to L4S and NQB per se, but are decisions 
		that can change depending upon differing technical, regulatory, business or other requirements. Even two network operators with the 
		same type of access technology and in the same market area may choose to implement in different ways. Nevertheless, this document 
		suggests that certain specific deployment decisions can help maximize the value of low latency networking to both users and 
		network operators.</t> 
		
		<t>It is also apparent from the IETF's work that it is clear that nearly all modern application types need low latency 
			to some degree and that applications are best positioned to express their needs via application code and packet marking. 
			Furthermore, unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency networking can better 
			balance the needs of different types of best effort flows (with some caveats - see <xref target="NewThinking"/>).

	    <section title="A New Understanding of Application Needs">
		    
		    
		    
		    <t>In the course of working to improve the responsiveness of network protocols, the IETF 
			    concluded with their L4S and NQB work that there were fundamentally two types of Internet traffic 
			    and that these two major traffic types could benefit from having separate network processing queues 
			    in order to improve the way the Internet works for all applications, and especially for interactive applications.</t>
			    
			    <t>One of the two major traffic types is Queue Building (QB) - things like file downloads and 
				    backups that are designed utilize as much network capacity as possible but with which users 
				    are usually not interacting with in 
			    real-time. The other was Non-Queue-Building (NQB) - such as DNS lookups, voice interaction 
			    with artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, video conferencing, gaming, and so on. NQB 
			    flows tend to be ones where the end user is sensitive to any delays.</t>
			    
			    
				<t>Thus, the IETF created specifications for how two different network processing 
					queues. Early results, such as from the IETF-114 hackathon 
					<xref target="IETF-114-Slides"/>, 
					demonstrate that L4S and NQB (a.k.a. dual queue networking, and simply "low latency networking" hereafter) can work 
					across a variety of access network technologies and deliver 
					extraordinary levels of responsiveness for a variety of applications. It seems likely that 
					this new capability will enable entirely new classes of applications to become possible, 
					driving a wave of new Internet innovation, while also improving the applications people use 
					today.</t>

		<section title="New Thinking on Low Latency Packet Processing" anchor="NewThinking">
			<t>The Introduction says that unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency networking can better 
				balance the needs of different types of best effort flows.
			But this bears a bit of further discussion to understand more fully.</t>
			
			<t>L4S does *not* provide low latency in the same way as previous technologies like DiffServ Quality of Service (QoS). That prior 
			QoS approach used packet 
prioritization, where it was possible to assign a higher relative priority to certain application traffic, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony. 
This approach could provide consistent and relatively low latency by assigning high priority to a partition of the capacity of a link, and then policing the 
rate of packets using that partition. This traditional approach to QoS is hierarchical in nature.</t>
			
			<t>That QoS approach 
			is to some extent predicated on an idea that network capacity is 
			very limited and that links are often highly utilized. But in today's Internet, it is increasingly the case that there is an 
			abundance of capacity to end users (e.g., symmetric 1 Gbps), which makes such traditional QoS approaches ineffective in 
			delivering ever-lower latency. This new low latency networking approach is not based on hierarchical QoS prioritization. 
			Rather, it is built upon conditional 
			priority scheduling between its two queues that operate at best effort QoS priority.</t>
			
		</section>
	    
	    <section title="Network Neutrality and Low Latency Networking">
		    <t>Network Neutrality (a.k.a. Net Neutrality, and NN hereafter) is a concept that can mean a variety 
		    of things within a country, as well as between different countries, based on 
		    different opinions, market structures, business practices, laws, and regulations. Generally speaking, 
		    NN means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not limit user choice or affect competition between 
			application providers. In the context of the United States' marketplace, it has come to mean that ISPs 
			should not block, throttle, or deprioritize lawful application traffic, and should not engage in paid 
			prioritization, among other things. The meaning of NN can be complex and ever changing, so the specific 
			details are out of scope for this document. Despite that, NN concerns certainly bear on the deployment 
			of new technologies by ISPs in many countries and so should be taken into account in making deployment decisions.</t>

			<t>It is also possible that there can be confusion - for people who are not deep in this highly technical subject - 
			between prioritization, provisioned 
		    end user capacity (throughput or bandwidth), and low latency networking. As it is envisioned in the design of the 
		    protocols, the addition of a low latency packet processing queue at a network link is merely a second 
		    packet queue and does not mean that this queue is hierarchically prioritized or that it has more 
		    capacity. Thus, a low latency queue does not create a so-called "fast lane" (in the way that 
		    this term is used in policy-related discussions in the U.S. to describe higher than best effort priority or greater 
			capacity being assigned to some traffic compared to default traffic) - 
		    but there are certainly other NN considerations in the operational implementation worth exploring.</t>
			
			<t>In short: implemented right, low latency networking is fully-aligned with net neutrality and has no 
			impact on user choice and competition.</t>

			<t>The principles below describe guidelines for a user-centric, application-agnostic, and monetizable implementation of  
			low latency networking that is aligned with NN frameworks and interpretations, at least in the U.S. and Europe.</t>

			<section title="Application-Agnostic Low Latency Networking">

			<t>A key principle of NN is that all applications should be treated the same by ISPs. As such, any application 
			should be able to request access to low latency networking using the available marking techniques, and the 
			network should forward packets through a low latency queue only based on such markings, without inferring 
			or taking into consideration from which application certain packets originate.</t>

			</section>

			<section title="User-Centric Monetization, Not Application Provider Monetization">

			<t>To incentivize low latency networking deployments, ISPs should be able to monetize it in some way, such as 
			by enabling it on specific tiers of service. This could be misinterpreted as paid prioritization. To avoid such 
			conflicts or misinterpretations, ISPs should charge users (and not application providers) for access to 
			low latency networking, and follow common charging regimes used for best-effort services. For example, 
			different price-points may be achieved by adjusting the throughput, monthly data allowance, in home network 
			equipment maintenance, in home network services (e.g., parental controls), provision of low latency networking, 
			or other service attributes. Thus, ISPs should not limit the number or types of applications that can access low 
			latency networking, as this would eventually conflict with the application-agnostic requirement.</t>

			</section>

	    
			<section title="Prioritization: Same Best Effort Priority for All Traffic">
		    	<t>A key aspect of NN is that traffic to certain Internet destinations or for certain 
			    applications should not be prioritized over other Internet traffic. This means in practice that all Internet traffic 
			    in an ISP network should be carried at the same (best effort) priority and that any network management practices 
			    imposed by the network should be protocol (application) agnostic. Low latency networking is fully consistent with this aspect of NN, 
			    because it is designed so that all traffic is treated on a best effort basis in the ISP network (this is not necessarily 
			    be the case for a user's in-home Wi-Fi network due to the particulars of how the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol <xref target="IEEE"/> functions at the current 
			    time - see <xref target="RFC8325"/>).</t>
			    
			    <t>In addition, as noted above, unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency networking can better 
				balance the needs of different types of best effort flows.</t>
	    	</section>
	    
			<section title="Throughput: Shared Across All Traffic">
		    	<t>Low latency networking is also consistent with the NN goal of not creating a fast lane, because the same end user 
			    	throughput in an ISP access network is shared between both classic and low latency (L4S/NQB) queues. Thus, 
			    	applications do not get access to greater throughput depending on whether or not the leverage 
			    	low latency networking.</t>
	    	</section>
	    	
	    	<section title="Access-Agnostic: Can Work on All Types of Network Technology">
		    	<t>Ultimately, the emergence of low latency networking represents a fundamental new network 
			    	capability that applications can choose to utilize as their needs dictate. It reflects a new ground truth 
			    	about two fundamentally different types of application traffic and demonstrates that networks 
			    	continue to evolve in exciting ways.</t>
				
				<t>In addition, this new network capability can be implemented in a variety of network technologies. For example in access network 
technologies this could be implemented in DOCSIS <xref target="LLD"/>, 5G <xref target="Ericsson"/>, PON <xref target="CTI"/>, and many other types of networks. Anywhere 
that a network bottleneck could occur may benefit from this technology.</t>

	    <section title="Recommended Deployment Decisions">
		    
		    <t>Like any network or system, a good deployment design and configuration matters and 
		    can be the difference between a well-functioning and accepted system and one that experiences 
		    problems and faces opposition. In the context of deploying low latency networking in an ISP network, 
		    this document describes some recommendations that should help 
		    to ensure a deployment is resilient, well-accepted, and creates the environment for generating 
		    strong network effects. In contrast, creating barriers to adoption in the early stages through design and 
		    policy decisions will presumably reduce the predicted potential network effect, thus choking off further 
		    investment across the Internet ecosystem, leading to a vicious circle of decline - and then the potential 
		    value is never realized.</t>
		    
	   
	    
	    <section title="Only Applications Mark Traffic">
		    
		    <t>Only applications should mark traffic to indicate their preference for the low latency queue, 
			not the network. This is for several reasons:</t>
		    <ul>
		    <li>According to the end-to-end principle, this function is best delegated to the edge of 
		    the network as an architectural best practice (the edge being the application in this case).</li>
		    <li>Application marking maintains the loose coupling between the application and network layers, 
		    eliminating the need for close coordination between networks and application developers.</li>
		    <li>Application developers know best whether their application is compatible with low 
			    latency networking and which aspects of their traffic flows will or will not benefit.</li>
		    <li>Application traffic is almost entirely encrypted, which makes it very difficult for networks 
		    to accurately determine application protocols and to further infer which flows will benefit from low latency 
		    and which flows may be harmed because they need to build a queue.</li>
		    <li>To correctly utilize L4S, the application and the server needs to use a scalable congestion control algorithm in order to 
			use the packet marking for L4S and respond to Congestion Experienced (CE) marking. This is done by using the ECN field of the packet header, with an ECT(1) marking, 
			according to Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC9331"/> and being responsibe to CE marks. 
			But only the application (not the network) knows what congestion control it is using. So, with L4S, the network cannot properly 
			mark on behalf of the application.</li>
			<li>To correctly utilize NQB for non-L4S traffic, then the DSCP field of the packet header is used, with a DSCP 45 marking, according to Section 
			4.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>. But the majority of traffic is now encrypted, 
			so it seems implausible for a network to try to infer the type of traffic and whether an application could benefit from NQB treatment; this 
			is best left to application developers to determine as they are the experts in the particular needs of their application. </li>
		    <li>Network operators and equipment vendors attempting to infer application type and application need 
		    will sometimes make mistakes, incorrectly classifying traffic <xref target="Lotus"/>, and potentially negatively 
		    affecting certain flows.</li>  
		    <li>The pace of innovation and iteration is necessarily faster-moving in the application edge at layer 7, 
		    rather than in the network at layer 3 (and below) - where there is greater standards stability and a lower rate of 
		    major changes. As a result, the application layer is best suited to rapid experimentation and iteration. Network 
		    operators and equipment vendors trying to infer application needs will in comparison always be in a reactive 
		    mode, one step behind changes made in applications.</li>
			<li>Note, however, that this does not preclude an ISP from changing packet marking within their internal network due to an existing use of a 
			particular code point.</li>
		    </ul>
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    
	    <section title="All Application Providers Welcome"> 
		    
		    <t>Any application provider should be able to mark their traffic for the low latency queue, with no restrictions 
		    other than standards compliance or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines. This 
		    maintains the loose cross-layer coupling that is a key tenet of the Internet's architecture by eliminating 
		    or greatly reducing any need for application providers and networks to coordinate on deployment (though 
		    such coordination is normal in the early experimental phase of any deployment).</t>
		    
		    <t>As noted above, this is another example that low latency networking will have strong network 
		    effects, any barriers to adoption such as this should be avoided in order to maximize the value to users 
		    and the network of a new low latency queue.</t> 
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="End User CPE Choice"> 
		    
		   <t>Both customer-owned and ISP-administered Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) should be supported (assuming that is 
           typical and technically feasible in a particular type of access network), when applicable. This avoids the risk that an 
           ISP can be 
		   perceived as giving preference to their own network demarcation devices, which may carry some monthly recurring fee or other 
		   cost. This also means that retail CPE manufacturers need to make the necessary development investment to 
		   correctly implement low latency networking, though this may not interest or may be outside the capabilities of some organizations.
		   In addition, the more devices that implement low latency networking, the broader adoption would be, positively 
           driving network effects.</t>
		   
	    </section>
			

			
	    <section title="Opt Out Capability During Technical Trial Experiments">
		    <t>During technical trial experiments of low latency networking, ISPs should consider making available some 
			    mechanism for users to opt out of (deactivate) it. If low latency networking is functioning correctly, it seems extremely 
			    unlikely that a user should ever want or need to turn it off. On the other hand, it is also possible that it may be 
                desirable in some troubleshooting situations to turn it off.</t> 
			    
				<t>As this technology enters normal production operation, there will not be a long term need or 
			    practical benefit to having an opt out mechanism. Thus, that mechanism will no longer be necessary or practical; 
                any problems should be handled 
				like typical production network problems.</t>
	    </section>
			
			<section title="Consider Traffic Protection">
				<t>The specifications in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/> describe a concept of Traffic Protection, also known as a 
                Queue Protection Function <xref target="I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection"/>. The document says that Traffic Protection 
                is optional and may not be needed in certain networks. In the case of an ISP deploying low latency networking with 
                two queues, an ISP should consider deploying such a network function to at least detect mismarking (if not necessarily 
                to correct mismarking). This may be implemented, for example, in end user CPE, last mile network equipment, 
                and/or elsewhere in the ISP network - or closely monitors network statistics and user feedback for any indication of 
                widespread NQB packet mismarking by applications.</t>
			</section>	
			
			<section title="Avoid Internal Remarking of DSCP Values if Possible">
				<t>If possible, based on a network's existing use of DSCP values, a network should try to maintain the use of DSCP 45 on an end-to-end basis 
				without remarking. While this may not be possible in all networks, it can reduce complexity, enable simpler network operations, and ease troubleshooting of NQB traffic flows. In some cases a network may need to migrate an existing, private internal use of DSCP 45 to some other mark to achieve this. In the long term that may be best, even if it takes a bit more initial effort when deploying low latency networking. In addition, if a network does have their own 
private internal use of DSCP 45, then they alone should be responsible for any necessary remarking for traffic passing through their network (it would be 
unfair and unreasonable for a given network's private use of a DSCP mark to pose a burden on other networks).</t>
			</section>	


			<section title="In Home Wi-Fi LAN Considerations">
				<t>As noted above with respect to prioritization of packets in the ISP network, all packets should be handled with the same 
				best effort priority. However, in a user's home Wi-Fi (wireless) local area network (WLAN), this is more complicated, 
                because there is not a precise mapping between IETF packet marking and IEEE 802.11 marking, explored in 
				<xref target="RFC8325"/>.</t>

				<t>In short, today's 802.11 specifications enable a Wi-Fi network to have multiple queues, using different "User Priority" and "Access 
				Category" values. At the current time, these queues are:</t>
				<ul>
					<li>User Priority 1 or 2, AC_BK = Background</li>
					<li>User Priority 0 or 3, AC_BE = Best Effort</li>
					<li>User Priority 4 or 5, AC_VI = Video</li>
					<li>User Priority 6 or 7, AC_VO = Voice</li>
				</ul>

				<t>Thus, as recommended in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>, the low latency queue should be different from 
                the best effort queue. That means default best effort traffic will be in User Priority 0 or 3 (AC_BE), and it is 
                recommended that the low latency queue 
				will be in User Priority 4 or 5 (AC_VI). For additional context, please refer to 
                Section 8.1 of  <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>.</t>

				<t>It is also worth noting that, in the short-term, Microsoft has taken a slightly different approach to packet 
				marking on their Xbox platform <xref target="Microsoft"/>. They are using DSCP-46 rather than DSCP-45, though presumably 
				once the IANA port assignment 
				for DSCP-45 is made this will change. As a result, a more permissive WLAN marking policy is initially recommended until RFCs for 
				NQB are published and developers coalesce around DSCP-45. This means that the network will put packets 
				marked with DSCP-46 (and potentially other values, such as 40 and 56) into the low latency queue. They are also using the AC_VO queue rather than the AC_VI queue, but it 
				is not known if that may change when the DSCP marking changes.</t>

            <section title="Pass Markings to Customer-Administered CPE">
				<t>In some cases, dual queue networking and associated packet marking is supported up to the ISP's demarcation point - 
                such as in a cable modem. It is recommended that packet markings should pass from such a demarcation point to 
                any attached customer-administered CPE, such as a router or wireless access point. That can, for example, 
                enable a customer-administered router to also implement dual queue networking, or for a wireless access point to act 
                on packet marking to put low latency networking traffic into the AC_VI Wi-Fi queue.</t>

		 <ol type="%d">
			 
		 	<li>Only Applications Mark Traffic: Not the network</li>
		 	<li>All Application Providers Welcome: Any application provider can mark with no restrictions other than standards compliance 
			 	or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines</li>
			<li>End User CPE Choice: When applicable, both customer-owned and ISP-administered devices supported</li>
			<li>Opt Out Capability During Technical Trial Experiments: Users can opt out during technical trial expriments</li>
			<li>Consider Traffic Protection: Consider potentially deploying a network function to detect mismarking of NQB traffic</li>
			<li>Avoid Internal Remarking of DSCP Values if Possible: Try to maintain DSCP 45 on an end-to-end basis with remarking</li>
            <li>Pass Markings to Customer-Administered CPE: Allow markings to pass to customer-administered network devices like routers 
            and access points</li>
