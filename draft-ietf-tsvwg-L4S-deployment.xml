		<t>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental RFCs for Low Latency, 
		Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior <xref target="RFC9330"/> 
		<xref target="RFC9331"/> <xref target="RFC9332"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4sops"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-dscp-considerations"/>. These documents do a good job of describing 
		a new architecture and protocol for deploying low latency networking. 
		But as is normal for many such standards, especially those in 
		experimental status, certain deployment decisions are ultimately left to implementers.</t>
		
		<t>This document explores the potential implications of key deployment decisions and makes 
		recommendations for those decisions that may help drive adoption. In particular, there are best practices based 
        on prior experience 
		as a network operator that should be considered and there are network neutrality types of considerations 
		as well. These technologies are benign on their own, but the way they are operationally implemented can 
		determine whether they are ultimately perceived positively and adopted by the broader Internet ecosystem. 
		That is a key issue for low latency networking, because the more applications developers and edge platforms that adopt 
		new packet marking for low latency traffic, then the greater the value to end users, so ensuring it is received well 
		is key to driving strong initial adoption.</t>
		
		<t>It is worth stating though that these decisions are not embedded in or inherent to L4S and NQB per se, but are decisions 
		that can change depending upon differing technical, regulatory, business or other requirements. Even two network operators with the 
		same type of access technology and in the same market area may choose to implement in different ways. Nevertheless, this document 
		suggests that certain specific deployment decisions can help maximize the value of low latency networking to both users and 
		network operators.</t> 
		
		<t>The IETF documents on L4S and NQB also made clear that nearly all modern application types - from video conferencing to web 
        browsing - can benefit from low latency networking. In addition, the design of the protocols also make clear 
        that applications developers are best positioned to understand the needs of their applications and to, 
        by extension, express any such low latency needs via appropriate L4S or NQB packet marking. 
			Furthermore, unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency networking can better 
			balance the needs of different types of best effort flows (with some caveats - see <xref target="NewThinking"/>).

	    <section title="A New Understanding of Application Needs">
		    
		    
		    
		    <t>In the course of working to improve the responsiveness of network protocols, the IETF 
			    concluded with their L4S and NQB work that there were fundamentally two types of Internet traffic 
			    and that these two major traffic types could benefit from having separate network processing queues 
			    in order to improve the way the Internet works for all applications, and especially for interactive applications.</t>
			    
			    <t>One of the two major traffic types is Queue Building (QB) - things like file downloads and 
				    backups that are designed utilize as much network capacity as possible but with which users 
				    are usually not interacting with in 
			    real-time. The other was Non-Queue-Building (NQB) - such as DNS lookups, voice interaction 
			    with artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, video conferencing, gaming, and so on. NQB 
			    flows tend to be ones where the end user is sensitive to any delays.</t>
			    
			    
				<t>Thus, the IETF created specifications for how two different network processing 
					queues. The performance value of dual queue networking (simply "low latency 
					networking" hereafter) has proven out in Comcast's 
					dual queue networking field trial <xref target="Comcast"/>. That field trial lasted for over a year and was 
					regularly reported on over time at several IETF TSVWG meetings <xref target="TSVWG-117"/> <xref target="TSVWG-118"/> 
					<xref target="TSVWG-119"/> <xref target="TSVWG-120"/> and demonstrated that 
					L4S and NQB can work deliver excellent responsiveness for a variety of applications - from video 
					conferencing to cloud gaming, DNS and other applications. It seems likely that 
					this new capability will enable entirely new classes of applications to become possible, 
					driving a wave of new Internet innovation, while also improving the applications people use 
					today.</t>

		<section title="New Thinking on Low Latency Packet Processing" anchor="NewThinking">
			<t>The Introduction says that unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency networking can better 
				balance the needs of different types of best effort flows.
			But this bears a bit of further discussion to understand more fully.</t>
			
			<t>L4S does *not* provide low latency in the same way as previous technologies like DiffServ Quality of Service (QoS). That prior 
			QoS approach used packet 
prioritization, where it was possible to assign a higher relative priority to certain application traffic, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony. 
This approach could provide consistent and relatively low latency by assigning high priority to a partition of the capacity of a link, and then policing the 
rate of packets using that partition. This traditional approach to QoS is hierarchical in nature.</t>
			
			<t>That QoS approach 
			is to some extent predicated on an idea that network capacity is 
			very limited and that links are often highly utilized. But in today's Internet, it is increasingly the case that there is an 
			abundance of capacity to end users (e.g., symmetric 1 Gbps), which makes such traditional QoS approaches ineffective in 
			delivering ever-lower latency. This new low latency networking approach is not based on hierarchical QoS prioritization. 
			Rather, it is built upon conditional 
			priority scheduling between its two queues that operate at best effort QoS priority.</t>

	    <section title="Key Low Latency Networking Concepts">
	    
			<section title="Prioritization: Same Best Effort Priority for All Traffic">
		    	<t>Low latency traffic to is not prioritized over other 
				(best effort priority) "classic" Internet traffic. That is the case over the ISP network and the 
				broader internet, though it may not not necessarily be the case for a user's in-home Wi-Fi network 
				due to the particulars of how the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol <xref target="IEEE"/> functions 
				at the current time - see <xref target="RFC8325"/>). In addition, some user access points 
				may prioritize certain traffic (such as gaming) and some traffic such as NQB may use the 
				AC_VI Wi-Fi link layer queue <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>. This best effort approach stands 
				in contrast to prior differential quality of service (QoS) approaches or to what has been discussed 
				for 5G network slicing <xref target="CDT-NN"/> <xref target="van-Schewick-1A"/> 
				<xref target="van-Schewick-1B"/> <xref target="van-Schewick-2"/> <xref target="van-Schewick-3"/>.</t>
	    	</section>
	    
			<section title="Throughput: Shared Across All Traffic">
		    	<t>Low latency networking flows do not get access to greater throughput than "classic" flows. 
				Thus, a user's total provisioned or permitted throughput on an ISP access network link is 
				shared between both classic and low latency queues.</t>
	    	</section>
	    	
	    	<section title="Access-Agnostic: Can Work on All Types of Network Technology">
		    	<t>Ultimately, the emergence of low latency networking represents a fundamental new network 
			    	capability that applications can choose to utilize as their needs dictate. It reflects a new ground truth 
			    	about two fundamentally different types of application traffic and demonstrates that networks 
			    	continue to evolve in exciting ways. This new network capability can be implemented in a 
					variety of network technologies. For example in access network technologies this could be 
					implemented in DOCSIS <xref target="LLD"/>, 5G <xref target="Ericsson"/>, 
					PON <xref target="CTI"/>, and many other types of networks. Anywhere that a network bottleneck 
					could occur may benefit from this technology.</t>

	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="Recommended Deployment Decisions">
		    
		    <t>Like any network or system, a good deployment design and configuration matters and 
		    can be the difference between a well-functioning and accepted system and one that experiences 
		    problems and faces user and/or developer opposition. In the context of deploying low latency networking in an ISP network, 
		    this document describes some recommendations that should help 
		    to ensure a deployment is resilient, well-accepted, and creates the environment for generating 
		    strong network effects. Following these recommendations should help avoid barriers to adoption and help provide a strong foundation 
			for growth.</t>
		    
	   
	    
	    <section title="Applications Mark Traffic">
		    
		    <t>The best approach is for applications to mark traffic to indicate their preference for the low latency queue, 
			not the network making such a decision on its own. This is for several reasons:</t>
		    <ul>
		    <li>According to the end-to-end principle, this function is best delegated to the edge of 
		    the network as an architectural best practice (the edge being the application in this case).</li>
		    <li>Application marking maintains the loose coupling between the application and network layers, 
		    eliminating the need for close coordination between networks and application developers.</li>
		    <li>Application developers know best whether their application is compatible with low 
			    latency networking and which aspects of their traffic flows will or will not benefit.</li>
			<li>Only the application (not the network) knows whether a scalable congestion control algorithm congestion control is being 
			used on the application server. Thus, only the developer and server administrator know if they are correctly responding to 
			Congestion Experienced (CE) markings for L4S (see Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC9331"/>). </li>
		    <li>Application traffic is almost entirely encrypted, which makes it very difficult for networks 
		    to accurately determine application protocols and to further infer which flows will benefit from low latency 
		    and which flows may be harmed because they need to build a queue. It is likely that false positives <xref target="Lotus"/> and false negatives 
			will occur if network-based 
			inference is used; all of which can be avoided simply by relying solely on application marking.</li>
		    <li>The pace of innovation and iteration is necessarily faster-moving in the application edge at layer 7, 
		    rather than in the network at layer 3 (and below) - where there is greater standards stability and a lower rate of 
		    major changes. As a result, the application layer is best suited to rapid experimentation and iteration. Network 
		    operators and equipment vendors trying to infer application needs will in comparison always be in a reactive 
		    mode, one step behind changes made in applications.</li>
		    </ul>
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    
	    <section title="Any Application Provider Can Mark Traffic - No Advance Permission"> 
		    
		    <t>Any application provider should be able to mark their traffic for the low latency queue, with no restrictions 
		    other than standards compliance or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines. This 
		    maintains the loose cross-layer coupling that is a key tenet of the Internet's architecture by eliminating 
		   the need for application providers and networks to coordinate and creates an environment of so-called "permissionless innovation".</t> 
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="Support a Variety of End User Equipment"> 
		    
		   <t>To create the best foundation for growth, both customer-owned and ISP-administered Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) should be supported 
		   (assuming that is typical and technically feasible in a particular type of access network), when applicable. In mobile networks, where a user 
		   device connects directly to the network, this may be easier as it simply depends upon operating system software in that end user device. In 
		   fixed networks, there is usually CPE that demarcates between the ISP network and the user's home LAN. The software running on those CPE devices 
		   will also need to support low latency networking, as well as software in other ISP network devices where CPE connections are aggregated. The more 
		   CPE devices that are enabled, the greater the pool of potential users, and thus the broader adoption would be, positively 
           driving network effects.</t>
		   
	    </section>
			
			<section title="Consider Queue Protection">
				<t>The specifications in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/> describe a concept of Traffic Protection, also known as a 
                Queue Protection Function <xref target="I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection"/> or simply Queue Protection. The document says that Traffic Protection 
                is optional and may not be needed in certain networks. In the case of an ISP deploying low latency networking with 
                two queues, an ISP should consider deploying such a network function to at least detect mismarking (if not necessarily 
                to correct mismarking). This may be implemented, for example, in end user CPE, last mile network equipment, 
                and/or elsewhere in the ISP network - or closely monitors network statistics and user feedback for any indication of 
                widespread low latency packet mismarking by applications.</t>
			</section>	
			
			<section title="Avoid Internal Remarking of DSCP Values if Possible">
				<t>If possible, for operational simplicity, a network should try to maintain the use of DSCP 45 on an end-to-end basis 
				without remarking in their interior network hops. This may not be possible in all networks, because some may already use DSCP 45 for some private 
				internal reason. In such cases, packets must obviously be remarked to and from DSCP 45 at the customer edge (CPE) and network ingress/egress to other 
				networks. But if DSCP 45 is not used internally, it is far simpler for network operations and troubleshooting to preserve that mark on an end 
				to end basis.</t>
			</section>	


			<section title="In Home Wi-Fi LAN Configuration">
				<t>As noted above with respect to prioritization of packets in the ISP network, all packets should be 
				handled with the same best effort priority. However, in a user's home 
				Wi-Fi (wireless) local area network (WLAN), this is more complicated, 
                because there is not a precise mapping between IETF packet marking and IEEE 802.11 marking,
				 explored in 
				<xref target="RFC8325"/>. In short, today's 802.11 specifications enable a Wi-Fi network to have multiple queues, 
				using different "User Priority" and "Access 
				Category" values. At the current time, these queues are AC_BK (Background), AC_BE (Best Effort), 
				AC_VI (Video), and AC_VO (Voice).</t>

				<t>As explored in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>, packets in the low latency queue 
				may be marked for the best effort (AC_BE) or video (AC_VI) wireless queue. For additional context, 
				please refer to Section 8.1 of  <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/>. In some situations, such as a 
				user-owned wireless access point or CPE, it may not be possible for the user to select which wireless 
				queue is used. In cases where the CPE is ISP-administered, selecting a specific wireless queue may be 
				possible - though it is not yet clear what the best practice may be for this selection until ISPs and 
				application developers have more experience with low latency networking.</t>
			</section>	

			<section title="Use Permissive Upstream NQB Queue Admission">
				<t>Since the IETF's NQB specification is only recently completed, many applications that have 
				been using other DSCP marks for their latency-sensitive flows have not yet shifted to adopt DSCP-45. 
				One example is the Microsoft Xbox platform <xref target="Microsoft"/>, which is using DSCP-46. 
				So in the relatively short-term, ISPs may find it beneficial to their customers to 
				use a more permissive upstream NQB admission policy, allowing DSCP-40, 45, 46, and 56 admission 
				into the low latency queue. It may take a year or more after the NQB DSCP assignment is made by IANA for  
				developers to shift to DSCP-45, given other items in their development backlog and their 
				software release schedule.</t>

			</section>	

            <section title="Pass Markings to Customer-Administered CPE">
				<t>In some cases, dual queue networking and associated packet marking is supported up to the ISP's demarcation point - 
                such as in a cable modem. It is recommended that packet markings should pass from such a demarcation point to 
                any attached customer-administered CPE, such as a router or wireless access point. That enables a 
				customer-administered router to implement dual queue networking, rather that it only being possible with 
				ISP-administered CPE.</t>

	    <section title="Security Considerations">
		  <t>The key security consideration pertains to Queue Protection. As the current time, it is recommended that 
		  implementers utilize Queue Protection, to ensure that any traffic that is incorrectly marked for low latency 
		  can be detected and remarked for the classic queue. The necessity of Queue Protection remains something of 
		  a debate, with some firmly believing it is necessary but others believing that it is not needed. The latter 
		  view is that application developers have a natural incentive to correctly mark their traffic, because to 
		  do otherwise would worsen the quality of experience (QoE) for their users. In that line of thinking, if a 
		  developer mismarks, they and/or their users will notice and they will fix that error. However, it is 
		  also conceivable that malicious software could be operating on a user's device or home network and that 
		  malicious software could try to send some much traffic to the low latency queue that the queue or both 
		  queues become unusable. This is quite similar to other "traditional" denial of servce (DoS) attacks, so it 
		  does not necessarily seems unique to low latency networking. But due to the possibility of this occuring, and 
		  low latency networking being such a new approach, it seems prudent to implement Queue Protection.</t>
	    </section>

		<section title="Regulatory Considerations">
		    <t>Network Neutrality (a.k.a. Net Neutrality) can mean a variety 
		    of things within a country, as well as between different countries, based on 
		    different opinions, market structures, business practices, laws, and regulations. Generally speaking, 
		    In the context of the United States' market, it has come to mean that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
			should not block, throttle, or deprioritize lawful application traffic, and should not engage in paid 
			prioritization, among other things. Net Neutrality concerns can sometimes affect the deployment 
			of new technologies by ISPs, so they should carefully consider regulatory issues when 
			making deployment decisions.</t>

			<t>As it is envisioned in the design of the IETF's new low latency networking protocols, the addition 
			of a low latency packet processing queue at a network link is merely a second 
		    packet queue and does not mean that this queue is hierarchically prioritized or that it has more 
		    capacity. As a result, low latency networking appears to pose no new Net Neutrality issues. However, 
			it is important for ISPs to keep these risks in mind as they make deployment design decisions.</t>

			<t>One key aspect of low latencty networking is that it operates, from the perspective of an ISP's 
			deployment, is application-agnostic. The ISP creates a second network queue on key network links, but 
			does not decide on their own what applications can use this queue. Rather, they add the queue and 
			packet flows are sent to that queue based on packet marking set by application developers. This 
			approach is far superior to older approaches, which caused significant Net Neutrality risks
			<xref target="Lotus"/>, 
			that used middleboxes to attempt to infer applications based on observing packet flows on ISP 
			network links.</t>
